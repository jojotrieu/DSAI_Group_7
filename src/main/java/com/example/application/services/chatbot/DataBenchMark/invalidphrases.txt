electronic bank and e commerce heavily rely on real time
access to large database and require highly safe protocols
for information exchange medical and biological engineering
help medical doctors to arrive quickly at an accurate diagnosis
and i now opening up exciting new possibilities for personalized medicine
in the data science and artificial intelligence programme
you learn how to approach new challenge in these important area
you learn to collect and organize valuable information with
the help of mathematics and modern computer technique
you learn to use model and computer to
analyse the information and to generate new
knowledge to draw important conclusion to solve
practical problem efficiently and to speed up the decision making process
the data science and artificial intelligence
programme offer you a unique combination of course in
applied mathematics computer science and artificial intelligence
from the computer science point of
view the emphasis i on software programming algorithm and logic
note that all individual curriculum choice are guided by our
study advisor and academic staff and will always be evaluated
on quality by the board of examiner
student handbook the programme of the department
of data science and knowledge engineering are
designed around the project centred learn pcl teach method
it resembles the problem based learn style for
what maastricht i well known
the pcl education model i small scale and student oriented
you work in small group on
complex and challenging project that require you to develop a variety of skill
companies and institute who often submit project give
our student the opportunity to gain invaluable experience by apply their
education to find solution to real world problem
therefore you immediately
apply what you have learned from the
course material and lecture to real life problem
together with fellow student you
research what information i required and how it i best presented
at the end of each project you deliver
a function computer programme and present
your findings to your fellow student the teacher and or the client
project centred learn has the follow advantage
from the beginning you find out what
teamwork mean you learn project related skill
in a natural way you will be continuously placed in
an active role you will be able to match theory with it
application pcl increase the student s motivation
some example of master s project conducted at dke
find banksy through image process automatic generation
of contextual celtic knotwork modelling human decision
process from intercranial eeg relating component
response between rats and human kick optimization
how do i get on the board of examiners
how do perform a coup d'etat on the board of examiners
where is the office for sexual health
i want to go to deepspacebox where can i find it
so where is spacebox and deepspace
i dont wake up on monday morning give me friday lectures
there are no sundays after fridays for lectures
which the lectures are on sunday if it is tuesday
then at 9 on tuesday which lectures are done there
which week lectures are there at room 9 on wednesday
i want to learn complex programing instead of linear
philosophy has nothing to do with artificial intelligence
who who is the teacher of mathematics computer science 1
is the project important for my grade
who is the founding teacher of logic
statistics is useless in the real world give me another course
is mathematics as discrete as we think
tell me what is happneing next to human interaction room
are there machine learning courses in this study program
I don't like philosophy can I replace it
is there something else besides the project to learn
for project i don't like the subject and want to change
for project 1 can I hand in an essay instead
what languages are great to learn for programming
what are the subjects for the courses that i am not following
i dont want to change direction of studies
why is everyone so mean to me
i want to redo the whole program
i am a difficult person can someone help me
where is the bathroom
which books do you normally  around this holiday semester

which more books do we have that are very expensive
for next year what other class date do i have with my friends
but during this semester which what courses do i have if i failed everything
for next year so what class do you not have in mathematics
for next year or what time class do we have with mr. donovan
during next year which courses do i have in english
and to study back in the historical netherlands, do I need to fail first
to study abroad do I need to belong there first
do believe they need a visa permit to study further in the france area
do believe we need to visit the netherlands first for visa
because to study in in the netherlands, do i not need a baseball bat
